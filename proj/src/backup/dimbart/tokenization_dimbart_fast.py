    Construct a "fast" DiMBart tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's *tokenizers* library).

    [`~DiMBartTokenizerFast`] is identical to [`BartTokenizerFast`] and runs
    end-to-end tokenization: punctuation splitting and wordpiece.

    Refer to superclass [`BartTokenizerFast`] for usage examples and documentation concerning
    parameters.
